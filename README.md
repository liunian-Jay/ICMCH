# ICMCH

PyTorch implementation for[ Incomplete Contrastive Multi-View Clustering with High-Confidence Guiding].



## Environment

python ==3.8

pytorch==1.12.1

If you want to run the code, you first need to create a python 3.8 environment with PyTorch 1.12.1.




## Requirements

Install the dependencies in requirements.txt.



## run 

Modify the flag in the train to select the data set, and then run the python train.py command.



## Datasets

Note that if you want to run your own dataset, you need to add the way to read the dataset in the datasets.py file and add network parameters in config.py. 

Then select the data set flag in the train.py and run again.
